# Recursive Exponentiation

This Java program demonstrates recursive exponentiation, computing a base raised to a given power.

## Usage

1. Run the program and provide a base and power as arguments.
2. The program will calculate the result of the base raised to the power using recursion.

## How to Run

Compile the program and execute the `Main` class, providing the base and power as command-line arguments.

Example:
```
java Main 2 3
2 raised to the power of 3 is: 8 
```
